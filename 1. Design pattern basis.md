# 1. Design pattern basis

## 1.1. What is the design pattern?

* Design pattern refers to a solution that is validated in software development to solve specific problems that recur in a specific environment.
  * The solution is the solution.
  * A specific problem indicates that it is not a silver bullet and can only solve a specific problem.
  * The design pattern is to solve recurring problems and reuse the summarized problem solutions.
  * The design pattern is used in a specific environment. Any problem arises with a scene. You can't leave the environment to discuss the solution to the problem.
  * Design patterns are proven, and these solutions are validated by enough applications and are recognized and verified by everyone.

## 1.1. Interface Review

### 1.1.1. The concept of interface

An interface is a special abstract class. Compared to other abstract classes of gen, all methods in the interface are abstract methods. All properties in the interface are constants.

### 1.1.2. The role of the interface

The interface defines the appearance of the implementation class, that is, the behavior definition of the implementation class, which is used to constrain the behavior of the implementation class. The interface is equivalent to a contract, and according to the functions required by the external application, the functions that the implementation class should implement are agreed upon.

By using interfaces, you can achieve the same behavior of unrelated classes without regard to the hierarchical relationship between these classes. The interface is the external appearance of the implementation class.

### 1.1.3. The idea of ​​the interface

Package isolation

Encapsulation is the encapsulation of the responsibility of the isolated body

Isolation refers to external calls and internal implementations. External calls can only be called through interfaces. External calls are not known internally.

### 1.1.4. Benefits of the interface

The interface isolates external calls and internal implementations, ensuring pluggability of the system and improving scalability and maintainability.

### 1.1.5. Selection of interfaces and abstract classes

1. Preferred interface
2. You should choose an abstract class when you want to define subclass behavior and provide public functionality for subclasses.
