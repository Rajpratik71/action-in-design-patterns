### 1.2.1. Design Principles

* Encapsulate what changes
* Open and close principle (open to open, closed for modification)
* Program to an interface, not an implementation: for abstract programming (the benefit of inheritance is not to reuse the implementation of the parent class, but to provide a unified interface for external use to better use polymorphic features )
  * Bad design! [image](http://clsaa-big-data-notes-1252032169.cossh.myqcloud.com/2018-12-04-021442.png)
  * Good design! [image](http://clsaa-big-data-notes-1252032169.cossh.myqcloud.com/2018-12-04-021302.png)![image](http://clsaa- Big-data-notes-1252032169.cossh.myqcloud.com/2018-12-04-021403.png)
  * Other types of objects can reuse our fly and quack behaviors because these behaviors are no longer hidden in the Duck class. We can add new behaviors without having to modify any existing behavior classes or touch any Duck class that uses flight behavior. Therefore, we get the benefits of REUSE without all the burden of inheritance.
* Synthesis
  * Add two instance variables to the above Duck class, be sure to refer to the parent class![image](http://clsaa-big-data-notes-1252032169.cossh.myqcloud.com/2018-12-04 -021849.png)
* Dynamically set behavior
  * Set the behavior of Duck's behavior!

* Favor composition over inheritance

## 1.3.Strategy mode

### 1.3.1. Purpose

Define a set of algorithms, encapsulate them, and make them interchangeable. The policy changes the algorithm independently of the client that uses it.

### 1.3.2. Motivation

There are many algorithms that can split a text into different lines based on different content.

Can use a lot of if to judge, it is obvious that this implementation is a lot better

```java
If (type == "strategyA"){

}else if (type == "strategyB"){

}

```

### 1.3.3.Scenario

* If you have many classes, they have many different behaviors
* Need to use the same type and different algorithms
* There is an algorithm, the data used by the algorithm (data structure, such as internal ArrayList or LinkedList is not determined) does not want to be exposed to the client
* A class defines a lot of behaviors, using a lot of if else to judge, we can wrap different if else into different subclasses, and then put the subclass new out into it.

### 1.3.4. Structure

### 1.3.5. Advantages and disadvantages

* The hierarchy of policy classes defines a set of algorithms or behaviors for context reuse
* Another implementation of subclasses
* Eliminate conditional statements
* Implementation choices. Policies can provide different implementations of the same behavior
* Customers need to understand each implementation and choose by themselves
* Communication performance overhead between policy and context
* Increased number of objects
