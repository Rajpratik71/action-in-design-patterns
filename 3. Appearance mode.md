Design# 3. Appearance mode

## 3.1. Introducing problems

### 3.1.1. Overview of the problem

In order to complete a certain function, the client needs to call multiple modules in a system and call them A module, B module, and C module. For the client, it is necessary to know A, B, and C. The functions of the modules also need to know how to combine the functions provided by these multiple modules to achieve the functions they need, which is very troublesome.

If there is a simple way for the client to implement the same function, then the client does not need to interact with multiple modules in the system, and the client does not need to know the details of so many modules. To achieve this is Facade.

### 3.1.2. Actual background

Consider such a practical application: code generation.

Many companies have such an application that can generate code based on configuration. Generally, such tools are used internally by the company, and are relatively proprietary tools. Most of the generated tools are common basic functions implemented according to the company's development structure, such as additions, deletions, and changes. In this way, each time the actual application is developed, the basic additions, deletions and changes can be realized at a very fast speed, and then the main energy is placed on the realization of the business function.

Of course, it is impossible to implement such a code generation tool. It requires the content of the whole book. It is only used here to illustrate the appearance mode.

Assuming that each module generated by the code has a basic three-layer architecture, which is divided into a presentation layer, a logic layer, and a data layer, then the code generation tool should have a corresponding code generation processing module.

In addition, the code generation tool itself needs a configuration management module, through configuration to tell the code generation tool, which layer of code each module needs to generate. For example, by configuration, it is only necessary to generate the presentation layer code, or to generate the three layers.

### 3.1.3. Scheme without mode

* Configuration class

```java

/**
 * Configure the description of the data Model, the actual configuration data will be a lot
 */
Public class ConfigModel {

    /**
     * Whether you need to generate a presentation layer, the default is true
     **/
    Private boolean needGenPresentation = true;

    /**
     * Whether you need to generate a logical layer, the default is true
     */
    Private boolean needGenBusiness = true;

    /**
     * Whether you need to generate DAO, the default is true
     */
    Private boolean needGenDAO = true;

    Public boolean isNeedGenPresentation() {
        Return needGenPresentation;
    }

    Public void setNeedGenPresentation(boolean needGenPresentation) {
        this.needGenPresentation = needGenPresentation;
    }

    Public boolean isNeedGenBusiness() {
        Return needGenBusiness;
    }

    Public void setNeedGenBusiness(boolean needGenBusiness) {
        this.needGenBusiness = needGenBusiness;
    }

    Public boolean isNeedGenDAO() {
        Return needGenDAO;
    }

    Public void setNeedGenDAO(boolean needGenDAO) {
        this.needGenDAO = needGenDAO;
    }
}

```

* Configuration management class

```java

/**
 * Configuration Management Module
 */
Public class ConfigManager {
    Private static ConfigManager configManager;
    Private static ConfigModel configModel;

    Private ConfigManager() {
    }

    Public static ConfigManager getInstance() {
        If (ConfigManager.configManager == null) {
            Synchronized (ConfigManager.class) {
                If (ConfigManager.configManager == null) {
                    ConfigManager.configManager = new ConfigManager();
                    ConfigManager.configModel = new ConfigModel();
                    / / Load configuration from the configuration file
                    ConfigManager.configModel.setNeedGenPresentation(true);
                    ConfigManager.configModel.setNeedGenBusiness(true);
                    ConfigManager.configModel.setNeedGenDAO(true);
                }
            }
        }
        Return ConfigManager.configManager;
    }


    Public ConfigModel getConfigData() {
        Return ConfigManager.configModel;
    }
}

```

* Presentation layer code generation class

```java


/**
 * Generate modules for presentation layer code
 */
Public class Presentation {
    Public void generate(){
        //1. Get configuration information from the configuration management class
        ConfigModel configModel = ConfigManager.getInstance().getConfigData();
        //2. Generate code
        If (configModel.isNeedGenPresentation()){
            System.out.println("Generate presentation layer code");
        }
    }
}

```

* Business layer code generation class

```java

/**
 * Modules that generate business layer code
 */
Public class Business {
    Public void generate(){
        //1. Get configuration information from the configuration management class
        ConfigModel configModel = ConfigManager.getInstance().getConfigData();
        //2. Generate code
        If (configModel.isNeedGenPresentation()){
            System.out.println("Generate Business Layer Code");
        }
    }
}

```

* Persistence layer code generation class

```java

/**
 * Modules that generate persistence layer code
 */
Public class Dao {
    Public void generate(){
        //1. Get configuration information from the configuration management class
        ConfigModel configModel = ConfigManager.getInstance().getConfigData();
        //2. Generate code
        If (configModel.isNeedGenPresentation()){
            System.out.println("Generate Persistence Layer Code");
        }
    }
}

```

* Client

```java

Public class Client {
    Public static void main(String[] args) {
        / / Now there is no configuration file, directly use the default configuration, usually, the three layers should be generated
        //This means that the client must have an understanding of these modules in order to use them correctly.
        New Presentation().generate();
        New Business().generate();
        New Dao().generate();
    }
}

```

### 3.1.4. Problem Analysis

A closer look at the implementation above, you will find one of the problems: that is, in order to use the function of generating code, the client needs to interact with multiple modules inside the generated code subsystem.

This is a hassle for the client, so that the client can't simply use the function of generating code. Moreover, if one of the modules changes, it may also cause the client to change.

## 3.2. Solution

### 3.2.1. Using the Appearance Mode to Solve the Problem

**Definition: Provides a consistent interface for a set of interfaces in the subsystem. The Facade pattern defines a high-level interface that makes this subsystem easier to use**

* Interface: The interface mentioned here mainly refers to the component from the outside of a component, what can be seen, this is the interface of this component, that is, the appearance.
* Interface: The interface here mainly refers to the external and internal interaction channels, usually refers to some methods, can make the method of the class, can also make the interface method, that is, the interface mentioned here, is not equivalent On the interface, there may be a class.

Analysis of the above problem, the client wants to operate more simple, then according to the needs of the client to define a simple interface to the client, and then let the client call this interface, the rest of the client does not care about it, This way the client becomes simple. The interface mentioned here is not an interface in java but a class in the skin mode, usually called "appearance".
