# 2.Simple factory mode

## 2.1. Introducing the problem

When we use the interface, we usually create an Impl instance on the client, assign it to a variable of type Api interface, and then the client uses this variable to manipulate the function of the interface.

Code example

* Define interface

```java

/**
 * interface
 */
public interface Api {
    void test(String str);
}

```

* Define interface implementation

```java

/**
 * Interface implementation
 */
public class Impl implements Api {
    public void test(String str) {
        System.out.println(str);
    }
}


```

It will be found that when the client calls, the client not only knows the interface, but also knows that the specific implementation is Impl. The idea of ​​the interface is "package isolation", and the implementation class Impl Should be interfaced Api Packaged and isolated from the client, the client should not know the specific implementation class is Impl。

Description of the problem: In programming, I only know the interface and I don't know the implementation. What should I do? Just like now Client, it knows to use Api Interface, but I don't know who implemented it, and I don't know how to implement it, so I can't use the interface without the interface object. What should I do?

## 2.2.solution

### 2.2.1. Using a simple factory to solve the problem

* Simple factory definition

Provides the ability to create an instance of an object without concern for its implementation. The type of instance being created can be an interface, an abstract class, or a concrete class.

* Apply simple factory to solve problems

Although you can't let the outside of the module know the specific implementation inside the module, you can know the implementation class inside the module, and you need to implement the class specifically.

Then, simply create a new class inside the module, create an interface in this class, and then return the created interface to the client, so that the external application only needs to get the corresponding interface object according to this class, and then you can operate The method defined by the interface. Calling such a class a simple factory is called a Factory.

The client can obtain the required interface object through the Factory, and then call the interface method to achieve the required functions, and the client does not have to care about the specific implementation.

### 2.2.2. Structure and code description

* Api: Defines the functional interfaces required by the customer.
* Impl: There may be more than one implementation class for implementing Api.
* Factory: Factory, select the appropriate implementation class to create the Api interface object.
* Client: The client, through the Factory to get the Api interface object, and then programming for the Api interface.

* Interface definition

```java

/**
 * interface
 */
public interface Api {
    void test(String str);
}

```

* Interface implementation A

```java

/**
 * Interface implementation
 */
public class ImplA implements Api {
    public void test(String str) {
        System.out.println("A:"+str);
    }
}

```

* Interface implementation B

```java

/**
 * Interface implementation
 */
public class ImplB implements Api {
    public void test(String str) {
        System.out.println("B:" + str);
    }
}

```

* Factory class

```java

public class Factory {
    public static Api createApi(int api) {
        if (api == 1) {
            return new ImplA();
        } else if (api == 2) {
            return new ImplB();
        } else {
            return null;
        }
    }
}

```

* Client

```java


/**
 * Client,Call interface
 */
public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Api api = Factory.createApi(1);
        api.test("hello");
    }
}

```

## 2.3.Pattern resolution

### 2.3.1. Typical question

* How does a simple factory implement package isolation? Does a simple factory not rely on a concrete implementation class?
  * The key to understanding this issue is to understand where the simple factory is located. The interface is used to encapsulate the specific implementation of the isolation, the goal is not to let the client know the specific implementation inside the package. The location of a simple factory is located inside the package, that is, the simple factory is connected with the interface and the concrete implementation. It is a class inside the package, so the simple factory knows that the specific implementation class is irrelevant.
  * For the client, just knowing the interface Api and the simple factory factory, you can get the Api through the factory, so that the client can get the interface Api without knowing the concrete implementation class.
  * So it seems that simply moving new Impl (this sentence from the client to the simple factory, in fact, there is a qualitative change.

### 2.3.2. Getting to know a simple factory

* Simple factory function
  * Simple factory is used to create things
* Static factory
  * When using a simple factory, you usually don't need to create a class instance of a simple factory class, there is no need to create an instance. So you can implement a simple factory class into a tool class, you can use the static method directly. If you want to prevent the client from being unnecessary To create a simple factory instance, you can also privatize the simple factory constructor and throw an UnsupportOperationException in the constructor.
* Universal factory
  * Simple factories can theoretically construct any object, but the general range should not be too large, and it is controlled within the scope of the component.
* Call sequence diagram

* Simple factory naming recommendations
  * The class name is suggested as "module name + Factory". For example, the factory of a user module is called a UserFactory.
  * The method name is usually "get+interface name" or "create+interface name". For example, if an interface name is UserEbi, then the method name is usually getUserEbi or createUserEbi.
  * There are also some accustomed to naming the method name "new+interface name". For example, newUserEbi, we do not advocate this. Because new represents a specific meaning in Java, and a simple factory method to get an object instance, it is not always necessary to new a new instance. If you use newUserEbi, it will give the illusion that it seems to be a new instance every time.

### 2.3.3. How to write a method in a simple factory

Although the simple factory method is mostly used to create interfaces, but careful analysis will find that the real implementation of the function is the specific implementation class, these implementation classes are already done, not really rely on simple factories The method of creating a simple factory is nothing more than: to choose a suitable implementation class to use.

So the main internal implementation of the simple factory method is to "select the appropriate implementation class" to create the instance object. Since you want to implement the choice, you need to select the condition or the selected parameter. The selection condition or the source of the parameter usually has the following types.

* From the client, the parameters are passed in by the Client
  * This method has a disadvantage, that is, the client must know the meaning of each parameter, and also need to understand the function processing corresponding to each parameter, which requires to expose the internal implementation details to the client to a certain extent.
* From the configuration file, get the value for judgment from the configuration file
* A value derived from the runtime of the program, such as getting the value of a runtime from the cache

### 2.3.4. Simple factory that can be configured

In the above implementation method, if you want to add an implementation class, you need to add a new judgment branch.

One solution is to use the configuration file. Once you have a new implementation class, just configure the new implementation class in the configuration file. Reflections can be used in simple factory methods, but can also be implemented using IoC/DI (Control Inversion/Dependency Injection, which is not discussed here).

Let's take a look at how to use the reflection plus configuration file to add a new implementation class, you can add this new implementation class to the application without modifying the code.

* Created under the package of the Factory

```java

import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStream;
import java.util.Properties;

public class Factory {
    public static Api createApi() {
        Properties properties = new Properties();
        InputStream in = null;
        in = Factory.class.getResourceAsStream("Impl.properties");
        try {
            properties.load(in);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("加载配置文件出错");
            e.printStackTrace();
        } finally {
            try {
                in.close();
            } catch (IOException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }

        Api api = null;
        try {
            api = (Api) Class.forName(properties.getProperty("ImplClass")).newInstance();
        } catch (InstantiationException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        } catch (IllegalAccessException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        } catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        return api;
    }
}


```

### 2.3.5.Advantages and disadvantages of a simple factory

* Simple factory has the following advantages.
  * Help package: The simple factory is very simple, but it is very friendly to help us achieve the package of the component, and then let the outside of the component really interface programming.
  * Decoupling: Decoupling between the client and the concrete implementation class is achieved through a simple factory. As in the above example, the client does not know exactly who is to implement it, nor how to implement it. The client only obtains the interface object it needs through the factory.
* Simple factories have the following disadvantages.
  * It may increase the complexity of the client. If the specific implementation class is selected through the parameters of the client, then the client must understand the specific functions and meanings represented by each parameter, which will increase the difficulty of the client and partially expose it. Internal implementation, this can be done in a configurable way.
  * It is not convenient to extend the sub-factory, privatize the constructor of a simple factory, use static methods to create interfaces, and you can't change the behavior of the methods that create interfaces by writing subclasses of simple factory classes. However, it is usually not necessary to create subclasses for simple factories.

### 2.3.5. Simple factory idea

* The essence of a simple factory
  * **The essence of a simple factory is to choose to implement**
  * Note that the focus of the simple factory is on the selection, and the implementation is already done. Even if the implementation is simple, it should be implemented by a concrete implementation class, rather than in a simple factory. The purpose of a simple factory is to choose the appropriate implementation for the client, thus decoupling between the client and the implementation. In this way, the specific implementation has changed, so there is no need to change the client. This change will be absorbed and blocked by the simple factory.
  * The difficulty in implementing a simple factory lies in the "how to choose" implementation. Earlier, there are several methods for passing parameters, which are static parameters and can be implemented as dynamic parameters. For example, during runtime, the factory reads the value of a certain memory, or reads the value in the database, and then selects a specific implementation based on this value.

* When to choose a simple factory
  * If you want to completely encapsulate the isolation implementation, so that the external can only operate the package through the interface, you can use a simple factory, let the client to obtain the corresponding interface through the factory, without concern for the specific implementation.
  * If you want to centrally manage and control the responsibilities of externally created objects, you can use a simple factory. A simple factory can create many unrelated objects. You can concentrate the responsibilities of externally created objects into a simple factory to achieve concentration. Management and control.

### 2.3.8. Related mode

* Simple factory and abstract factory pattern
  * Simple factory is used to choose implementation, you can choose the implementation of any interface. A simple factory can have multiple methods for selecting and creating objects, and objects created by multiple methods can be related or unrelated.
  * Abstract factory pattern is used to select the implementation of the product cluster, which means that there are multiple methods in the general abstract factory for selecting and creating objects, but the objects created by these methods are usually related to each other. The objects created are usually the component objects that are needed to form a product cluster.
  * So in a sense, simple factories and abstract factories are similar. If the abstract factory degenerates into only one implementation, regardless of hierarchy, it is equivalent to a simple factory.
* Simple factory and factory method mode
  * Simple factory and factory method modes are also very similar.
  * The essence of the factory method is also used to choose implementation. The difference from the simple factory is that the factory method delays the selection of specific implementation functions into subclasses.
  * If the implementation of the choice in the factory method is implemented directly in the parent class, it is equivalent to a simple factory.
* Simple factory and patterns that can create object instances
  * The essence of a simple factory is to choose implementation, so it can be used with any other pattern that can specifically create object instances, such as singleton mode, prototype mode, generator mode, etc.。
